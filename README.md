# Polyvisual
### My winning entry for the 2022 Swift Student Challenge.

My project, "Polyvisual," aims to teach users about complex rhythmic concepts through interactive visuals and sounds. These concepts include polyrhythms and polymeters, both things that I (as a percussionist) find fascinating, and I wanted to be able to explain these concepts to others in a fun and interesting way.

*Excuse the messy code, I was learning Swift from scratch as soon as I started this project :)*
